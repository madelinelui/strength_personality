This project investigates whether physical strength is associated to fearful personality in male and female participants. Raw dataset downloaded from Kaggle, from the Manson et al. (2022) study. 

Participants from Samples 1-2 and Samples 3-5 were wrangled separately due to the different fearful personality scales used in data collection.
Model comparison including ethnicity was only performed for Sample 1, and Samples 3, 5, due to missing data in Samples 2 and 4.
